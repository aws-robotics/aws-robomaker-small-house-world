![Gazebo01](docs/images/gazebo_01.png)

**Visit the [AWS RoboMaker website](https://aws.amazon.com/robomaker/) to learn more about building intelligent robotic applications with Amazon Web Services.**

# Include the world from another package

* Update .rosinstall to clone this repository and run `rosws update`
```
- git: {local-name: src/aws-robomaker-small-house-world, uri: 'https://github.com/aws-robotics/aws-robomaker-small-house-world.git', version: ros2}
```
* Add the following to your launch file:
```python
    small_house = launch.actions.IncludeLaunchDescription(
        launch.launch_description_sources.PythonLaunchDescriptionSource(
            os.path.join(
                get_package_share_directory('aws_robomaker_small_house_world'),
                'launch',
                'small_house.launch.py')))
```

# Load directly into Gazebo (without ROS)
```bash
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=`pwd`/models
gazebo worlds/small_house.world
```

# ROS Launch with Gazebo viewer (without a robot)
```bash
# build for ROS
source /opt/ros/dashing/setup.bash
source /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh
rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src -r -y
colcon build

# run in ROS
source install/setup.sh
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle_pi
ros2 launch aws_robomaker_small_house_world small_house.launch.py gui:=true
```

# Building
Include this as a .rosinstall dependency in your SampleApplication simulation workspace. `colcon build` will build this repository.

To build it outside an application, note there is no robot workspace. It is a simulation workspace only.

```bash
rosws update
rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src -r -y
colcon build
```

# How to Replace Photos in Picture Frames

Picture frames use two textures for the model:
 - `aws_portraitA_01.png` - Frame texture
 - `aws_portraitA_02.png` - Picture texture

To change a picture, one has to replace the `aws_portraitA_02.png` file. The new image will look best with same aspect ratio as the replaced image.

Below is a table showing portrait type to picture resolution data and custom images from photos/.

| Portrait Model | Resolution | Photo |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DeskPortraitA_01 | 650x1024 | |
| DeskPortraitA_02 | 650x1024 | doug |
| DeskPortraitB_01 | 650x1024 | |
| DeskPortraitB_02 | 650x1024 | |
| DeskPortraitC_01 | 1024x1024 | |
| DeskPortraitC_02 | 1024x1024 | |
| DeskPortraitD_01 | 1024x1024 | |
| DeskPortraitD_02 | 1024x1024 | |
| DeskPortraitD_03 | 1024x1024 | |
| DeskPortraitD_04 | 1024x1024 | ray |
| PortraitA_01 | 700x1024 | tim |
| PortraitA_02 | 700x1024 | anamika |

# Disclaimer

All objects in the scene should be static objects as intended for this sample app.
If there is a need for some of objects to be non-static, change their 'static' flag in the world file to 'false', 
and make sure they have correct mass and inertia values in their model.sdf
Link: http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=inertia&cat=build_robot

Currently, objects in scene have inconsistent mass and inertia values, they will be fixed in the future change.
Inconsistent mass and inertia should not affect static object simulation.
